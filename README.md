## What Is It?

Greed is a game launcher that features it's own embedded BitTorrent client and a dynamic torrent source scrapper; The main project's goal is to be the most *decentralized*, *transparent*, *distributed* and *cheap* as possible. It's written in Typescript built over Electron, allowing users to use the launcher locally without any external central server.
